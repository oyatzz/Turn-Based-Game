# Overview
Shadows of Eldoria is a turn-based 3v3 strategy game fully coded in Java, inspired by the story of five childhood friends whose peaceful kingdom was destroyed by the Darklord. United by loss and driven by vengeance, they rise as legendary heroes, each taking on a unique combat role: Mage, Assassin, Marksman, Tank, and Fighter.

The game focuses on tactical decision-making, where players form a 3-hero team and face enemies in strategic, turn-based battles. Every move matters, by choosing the right skills, managing health, and predicting enemy actions determines victory. With its mix of fantasy lore, character roles, and strategic gameplay, Shadows of Eldoria delivers a simple yet immersive experience that showcases Java programming fundamentals, and game logic implementation.
